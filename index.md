### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about how to code and where to start. During this lab, I was able to see and write my first lines of code, which was exciting. It was also a good way to get to meet my classmates and make new connections when I didn't know anyone.

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 2, was one of my favorites because I liked the fact that we got to create a game that worked and improve upon it in this lab. We faced some challenges with the code, but when we got everything to work, it was fun to play the game that we had created ourselves. It was also a valuable experience to enhance a code that we had written before.

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 2, was a favorite because I didn't know how the game Blackjack worked. I was able to create this game with my partner and learn how to play it at the same time. My partner and I also worked on debugging during this lab and developed our debugging skills.
